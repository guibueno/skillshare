## Structure

### Aula 1 - Preparation

1. Who am I? 
* Majored in Arts/Communication
* Instructional Designer by NYU
* The core of my work is in Language Learning
* Foreign Language Anxiety Specialist

2. The problem with brainstorms
* Eveyrone thinks they know how to do one brainstorm
* Overused word that ends up meaning nothing
* Means: having ideas, which is super vague
* Group brainstorms (my focus) end up being bad
* I want to help people make such brainstorms more productive
* Motivated to help people create safe environments for expressing their ideas

3. Hints that come from:
* Text By IDEO
* Life Experience: I'm not so good at following plans, but I usually make people comfortable to have ideas with me.
* Hackathon Participations
* Always found it hard to decide what to do
* Figured that very late in life that brainstorms can be very useful

4. Project
* Ideally, a brainstorm.
* Pictures of a successful brainstorm.
* Results of a brainstorm.
* Notes from a brainstorm.
* Youtube link to a brainstorm.
* Hints for even better brainstorms.

5. Conclusion
* Hope you enjoy,
* This is intended to be all very fast and bite-sized
* I'm all available to assist you.
* Brainstorm! (BASS!)

### Aula 2 - Defining
* Not regular meeting. Not something you take notes at. You don’t take turns speaking. Not work.
* It shouldn’t consume a morning. Sixty minutes is ideal. High level of physical and mental energy.
* “The buzz of a good brainstormer can infect a team with optimism and a sense of opportunity”.
* Good: Sharpen the focus: Statement of the problem. “Go for something tangible that participants can sink their teeth into, without limiting the possible solutions”. Focus outward, on customer need or service, rather than inward, on some organizational goal.
* It's hard to get everyone in the same room at the same time, so following a procedure helps you take the most out of it.

### Aula 3 - Preparation
* Everyone that will participate should be "prepared" for a brainstorm.
* Homework: background reading, store looking, etc. This can bring more ideas to the session.
* That is, some knowledge must exist, or some homework must have been done.
* Not the time to learn, discuss, explain.
* Bring in everything to have materials on hand to build crude models of a concept, like blocks and bricks.
* LOTS OF POST-ITS AND PENS
* Get a room, soundproof, especially

### Aula 4 - Warm-ups
* Stretch your mental muscles: warm-up, mainly if team hasn’t done that before or is distracted.
* Creative/Fun mood has to be set.
* It's important that everyone feels lose and comfortable from the beginning.
* List a few useful design/fun ice-breakers.

### Aula5 - Dos
* Playful roles
* Build and jump: energy up.
* Take notes
* Number your ideas: Tool to motivate before and during session. Jump back and forth to ideas.
* Space remembers: post-its, cover walls, etc. Google Docs can be useful, as I’ve seen.
* Get physical: “Leave your performance anxieties at the door and jump in with whatever visual tools you have available”.
* Bodystorming: we act out current behavior/usage patterns and see how they might be altered.
* friendly competition where people should feel comfortable to take chances*

### Aula 6 - Don'ts
* Mainly, Too serious. Too much writing.
* Don’t start to critique or debate ideas. Ring a bell when participants try to turn a brainstorm into a normal meeting.
* Bad: Boss speaks first. Everybody gets a turn. Expert snobs (non-expert has field experience)
* Off-site: Not wrong, but “you want the buzz of creativity to blow through your offices”.

### (BONUS) Google Docs alternative
* Maybe everyone should open the same Google Doc file
* This can work with teams you're very comfortable with, such as university groups
* Follow the same guidelines in a virtual way

### Aula 6 - Project + Good Bye
* Thanks
* Hopefully you will Brainstorm with people
* Hopefully this will bring you insights
* Post anything that refers to a brainstorm you've conducted

## Notes

IDEO, America’s Leading Design Firm. They call “brainstormer” a brainstorm session there.

You can become a brainstorming virtuoso. An art, like playing the piano. More than 1x/month.

Not regular meeting. Not something you take notes at. You don’t take turns speaking. Not work.

It shouldn’t consume a morning. Sixty minutes is ideal. High level of physical and mental energy.

“The buzz of a good brainstormer can infect a team with optimism and a sense of opportunity”.

Good: Sharpen the focus: Statement of the problem. “Go for something tangible that participants can sink their teeth into, without limiting the possible solutions”. Focus outward, on customer need or service, rather than inward, on some organizational goal.

Playful roles: Don’t start to critique or debate ideas. Ring a bell when participants try to turn a brainstorm into a normal meeting.

Number your ideas: Tool to motivate before and during session. Jump back and forth to ideas.

Build and jump: energy up. Didn’t understand well this one.

Space remembers: post-its, cover walls, etc. Google Docs can be useful, as I’ve seen.
*Maybe everyone should open the same Google Doc file*

Stretch your mental muscles: warm-up, mainly if team hasn’t done that before or is distracted.

Get physical: “Leave your performance anxieties at the door and jump in with whatever visual tools you have available”. Bring in everything to have materials on hand to build crude models of a concept, like blocks and bricks.

Bodystorming: we act out current behavior/usage patterns and see how they might be altered.

Brainstorm Effect: Chance to shine. Friendly competition. Comfort zone: people take chances

Bad: Boss speaks first. Everybody gets a turn. Expert snobs (non-expert has field experience)

Off-site: Not wrong, but “you want the buzz of creativity to blow through your offices”.

Too serious. Too much writing.
